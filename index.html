		<h1><b>Welcome!</b></h1>
		<p>Hello! Welcome to My Manga Website! If you're not familiar with mangas, mangas are comic books and/or graphic novels drawn/published
		in Japan. Manga artists (Mangaka) will release chapters
		usually on a weekly/monthly basis depending on their workload. Once a certain amount of chapters has been released, those chapters are condensed into a volume.
		These volumes then get published and are sold to the general public at most typical bookstores all over the world. </p>
		<!-- h2 explains the basic chracterisics of a typical manga-->
		<h2>Chracterisics of Manga</h2>
		<p>Like a normal comic book/graphic novel, each manga page is organized into panels which will contain a drawing and/or speech bubbles of text to explain to give the reader context about the story.
		However, unlike Something much different than comic books and graphic novels made in the West, manga panels are typically read from right-to-left
		because of how Japanese writing is written and read right to left. Also, unless the artist is releasing a special version (or if they <b>REALLY</b> feel like it)
		manga pages are made in black & white. This is to help cut down costs for buyers and helps mangakas & their assistants create more pages more effienctly<p>

		<h3>How & Why Did I Get Into Reading Mangas?</h3>
		<p>I started reading mangas around August 2021. I went to a Newbury Comics store in Boston, MA with two friends
		just to browse and look at all the nerdy stuff they have inside. One of those friends and I were big into watching
		anime (Japanese-styled cartoons based on manga) and talked about it super often with each other. 
		We loved stories like Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, Love is War, Jujutsu Kaisen, etc. so walking into the story was like a manga heaven for both of us.</p>

		<p>As we both went to the manga section and freaking out over all the mangas available to collect, I noticed all the volumes
		of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure Part 4. The art made by the Mangaka Hirohiko Araki had me in a trance. I never thought
		how great the art looked on the paper itself, considering the only thing I had seen related to it was the anime.
		Every single page was full of incredible detail. That was probably the first time I ever I appreciated art and the work put
		in to make an amazing story. After making an impulsive decision to buy a volume of Jojos, I've been collecting and reading mangas ever since. I love reading stories
		that can have great moral lessons (such as Vinland Saga or Vagabond) and stories with incredible attention to detail in it's art.
